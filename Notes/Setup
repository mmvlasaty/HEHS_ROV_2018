*** If there is some problem with the control system that you don't know how to fix, send me a message ***

Control System Setup:
1) Power the board, make sure ethernet module LED and board power LED (5V) are on
2) Connect the ethernet module to a router LAN port
3) Connect the laptop to a router LAN port
4) Make sure that the orange and green lights are on for both the laptop ethernet port and the ethernet module port
5) Open a command prompt and type 'ping 192.168.0.177', make sure there is a response
    If there is no response from the ethernet module, open the network settings for the laptop
    Double check that there is a wired connection and that it is enabled (under change adapter settings)
6) Open 'i2c_ip.py' with IDLE and run it. This is a test program that should run a motor
    The shell window that opens when you run the program will print a message if the laptop successfully connects to the board
    If there is an error in the shell (red text), try to understand the source of the problem
    Make sure that you followed all of the previous steps
    If you get an error that you really don't understand, screenshot it and send it to me
7) Open the control program you want to use and run it
    If you lose communication with the ROV or if the ROV becomes unresponsive, stop the program by closing the shell window
    Cycle the power and repeat step 5 before restarting the program
    Make sure that there is a delay in your main program loop (board.sleep(sec))
    This is to prevent the laptop from sending information faster than the board can respond

General Troubleshooting:
- Pay attention to the current reading on the power meter and the LEDs on the board.
  If the current spikes or the LEDs go out, there could be a short, and you should turn the ROV off and examine the board.

- If the board is not getting power, use a meter to check that there is 12V across the power screw terminals.
  If board is getting 12V but the power LED is not on, make sure that diodes D1 and D8 have been replaced with a single Schottky diode (STPSC8065).
    If the pads for D1 or D8 are shorted, you should replace the wire with one of these diodes.
  If there is still a problem, check the voltage output of the 5V regulator and replace it if needed.

- Calibrating motor direction should be done through wiring (flip any 2 wires to change direction).
  You should be able to do this once and never have to change it.
  However, if you need to change it last minute, flip the sign of the throttle value in the control program.

- Pay attention to the shell window while the program is running.
  The program should continually print throttle values to the shell.
  If the ROV isn't responding, check the shell window.
    - If throttle values are being printed intermittently, try replacing the ATMega chips
    - If throttle values aren't being printed or if there is an error, connection has been lost and the program needs to be reset.
    (If you continue to lose connection randomly, let me know)

- If one of the motors is not running, you should:
    - Make sure that you are using the board_i2c_write_request command correctly (double check with other programs)
    - Make sure that all 3 of the motor wires are connected to the same ESC screw terminal on the board
    - Check for 12V on the ESC screw terminal
    - Swap the ESC ATMega8 chip with another that has the same ID and is known to be working
