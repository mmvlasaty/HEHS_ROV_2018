* Callbacks now report pin type. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-aio/wiki/Digital-And-Analog-Data-Reporting-Callback--Usage-Guidelines) for details. Note this should not be a breaking change. All existing applications should be able to run without modification.

24 August 2016

* This is a minor bug fix release

  * Added a 2 second timeout for retrieiving Firmata Firmware Verison
  * If the request times out, the application will exit since there is no connectivity to the Arduino.

## Release 2.15

31 July 2016

* Added support for the SET_DIGITAL_PIN_VALUE Firmata command

  * This release is now fully compatible with StandardFirmata 2.5.3
  * On-Line API Documents Updated to reflect new command

* Update pymata_iot.py to use websockets instead of autobahn.

## Release 2.14

26 July 2016


* Arduino Firmware Version information is printed as part of start-up banner

* An additional FirmataPlus variant was created to support AVR 32u4 boards.
* Corrected 2 calls to asyncio.sleep in pymata_serial.py that were missing awaits. These fixes should not affect the performance of the pymata_aio library, and therefore updating to this release from 2.13 is optional.
* Forced txaio (required by autobahn) to an earlier release (2.1.0) to avoid warnings generated in latest version.

## Release 2.13

21 April 2016
